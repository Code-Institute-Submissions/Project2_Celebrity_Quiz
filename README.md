The celebrity quiz is designed to be fully interactive, utilsing event listeners to create a image flip function which reveals a portion of a celebrity with each click. Each click then reduces the number of points which can be won in that particular round. the built in object, Math allows random question selection and order and sound effects are used to make the quiz engaging. It is designed to be responsive on multiple devices with a focus on simple, linear navigation. I chose this project mainly as a demonstration of the flexibility and range that Javascript allows.
